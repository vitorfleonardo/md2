# üîê Discrete Math II Project

This repository contains a C language implementation of a **modular arithmetic validator system**, developed as part of the **Discrete Mathematics II** course at the University of Bras√≠lia (UnB - FGA), during the first semester of 2025.

üìò This project demonstrates the application of number theory concepts such as **modular arithmetic**, **coprimality**, **primality**, **modular exponentiation**, and classical theorems like **Fermat** and **Euler**, in a real algorithmic problem-solving scenario.

## Context

This algorithm was built as part of an academic exam. The task was to simulate a mathematical verification mechanism for system access ‚Äî a form of **mathematical security** using modular congruence checks.

It combines concepts such as:

- Prime verification (Euclidean Algorithm)
- Modular inverses (Extended Euclidean Algorithm)
- Efficient modular exponentiation
- Fermat‚Äôs Little Theorem
- Euler‚Äôs Theorem and Euler‚Äôs Totient Function œÜ(n)
- The Division Theorem

The output must show a **detailed step-by-step breakdown**, mimicking a pedagogical mathematical explanation.

## What the Algorithm Does

Given five positive integers **H, G, n, x, n1**, the program:

1. Validates if G and n are coprime.
2. Computes the **modular inverse of G mod n** using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
3. Calculates the modular division **a = H ‚äò G in Zn**.
4. Checks if **a and n1** are coprime.
5. Determines whether **n1 is prime**.
6. Depending on primality:
   - Applies **Fermat‚Äôs Little Theorem** if prime
   - Applies **Euler‚Äôs Theorem** otherwise
7. Decomposes the exponent **x = q¬∑œï(n1) + r**
8. Rewrites the expression `a^x mod n1` based on that decomposition
9. Efficiently computes the final result step-by-step, printing each operation.

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
gcc main.c
./a.out
```

You will be prompted to enter 5 positive integers: H, G, n, x, n1
The program will then execute and display a full breakdown of the congruence logic.
